# TorrentFreakReader

An iOS app to read articles from TorrentFreak.com. This is basically a small project to learn about Swift and SwiftUI, so some things are not that great. Since this app uses web scraping to get the article content, there are some cirumstances where parts of the article will be missing from the app. Generally speaking, the articles display in the app pretty well.

Some features:

- Search TorrentFreak for articles
- Save articles to read later (utilizes SQLite.swift)
- Read indicator after reading an article, along with the option to disable the indicator (kinda jank, but it works!)
- Share options for articles
- Displayes article categories

If for some crazy reason you'd like to make a change to this app feel free to open a PR :)
